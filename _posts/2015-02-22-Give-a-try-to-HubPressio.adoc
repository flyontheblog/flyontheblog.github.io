= Give a try to HubPress.io

I told you that this blog will be focused on WildFly. OK, but my first _real_ one won't. For this one, I would like to share my love with http://hubpress.io[*HubPress.io*].

Few weeks ago, I decided to start a new blog. I had to decide wether I should start it on https://www.blogger.com[Blogger] like my previous one or with an other tool. Blogger is cool for starting a new blog, becasuse you can start very fast, with just a few setup. But after several years, I find it boring, especially when it comes with writing source code. And it generates an aweful HTML code. And it's proprietary. Wordpress may be a better option. Or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_Now_for_Something_Completely_Different[something completely different]...

In the meantime, I discovered Asciidoctor. It's really cool for writing documentation. It has been adopted by a lot of open source projects and I've started to use it at work. Why not using it for a blog ? The first answer is : because it needs much more setup than Blogger or Wordpress. 

Here comes http://hubpress.io[*HubPress.io*]. In a few minutes, I could start writing the Welcome post, online in the AsciiDoc format, host by GitHub pages. All what I wanted.

* *Github organization* : I already had an organisation call flyontheblog, so that I could have a dedicated GitHub page.
* *Clone the repository* : I've clone the HubPress.io repository, and renamed it to flyontheblog.github.io
* *Setup* : I've put the settings in the /hubpress/config.json file, configured online the title and description of the blog, and choose a template.
* *Write* : Yeah, it's online, I can write a Welcome post.

Try it, it's really cool, even if it's only in preview.

And of course, there are other ways to make it work, read the doc if you want to know more about it. And give feedback to http://github.com/anthonny[Anthonny Qu√©rouil].
