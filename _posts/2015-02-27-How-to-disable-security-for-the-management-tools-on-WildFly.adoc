= How to disable security for the management tools on  WildFly ?

== Why ?

Yes, why would I disable authentication a let anybody access to the management tools ? Oh, just for dev / test stuff. 

I'm working on a home made console that uses the HTTP/JSON API, and it is much easier to test the console towards a non secured WildFly.

== How ?

In the default configuration, the management interface is configured this way :

[source,ruby]
----
<management-interfaces>
  <http-interface security-realm="ManagementRealm" http-upgrade-enabled="true">
    <socket-binding http="management-http"/>
  </http-interface>
</management-interfaces>
---- 

I've dropped the *security-realm* attribute : 


---- 
<management-interfaces>
  <http-interface http-upgrade-enabled="true">
    <socket-binding http="management-http"/>
  </http-interface>
</management-interfaces>
---- 

Now I can acces to the Web console (http://localhost:9990) without being asked to log in. And I can use the HTTP API (http://localhost:9990/management) without a username and password.
